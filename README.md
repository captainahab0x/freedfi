Trustless & Transparent: Smart contracts are used for loan requests, transfers and trust credential issuance. FreedFi ensures a seamless and efficient experience for both freelancers and investors. 

## Problems We're Solving

Freelancers face overwhelming difficulties in obtaining loans due to the absence of a steady work history, which hinders their access to traditional lending options. This hinders dreams of sustainable living, home ownership, car leasing and more. 

Data on the challenge:
- According to a survey conducted by Upwork, 58% of freelancers reported facing challenges in securing financing due to the lack of a stable income source.
- The Federal Reserve's 2020 Small Business Credit Survey revealed that 70% of non-employer firms, which often include freelancers, experienced funding shortfalls, highlighting the struggle they face in accessing capital.
- A study by the Freelancers Union found that 63% of freelancers reported having difficulty obtaining a mortgage due to their irregular income, underscoring the limitations they encounter in traditional loan applications.

There is no decentralized lending platform that allows for private, uncollateralized loans. We aim to offer our solution to tight-knit communities that want to leverage DeFi bring credit capital and investment returns to members.
  
## Smart Contracts

Trustless & Transparent: Smart contracts are used for loan requests, transfers and trust credential issuance. FreedFi ensures a seamless and efficient experience for both freelancers and investors.

- Investors approve loans and receive payback. 
- FreedFi fund the loan and issues Trust Credentials.

PoolControler.sol
- FreedFi manages investor funds trasparently https://github.com/captainahab0x/freedfi/blob/main/contracts/src/PoolController.sol

TrustCredential.sol
- TrustCredentials are issued after loan is repaid. Python script determins the reliability score by calculating date of return compared to date due.
  
Contracts are deployed on the following blockchains:
Celo - GetALoan.sol - 0x1E758656f3Ba1aC562b6D93D08E2ffE0DbE347B0 PoolController - 0x8F78e0fa1a25eb313408C4C70EFa5C8AAB04556E
